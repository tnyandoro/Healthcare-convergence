# HEALTH CONVERGENCE 

## What it does
A medical roaster and booking app between medical facilities and medical professional providers. The app is meant to connect medical service providers to shifts on medical facilities calendars. These will be hospitals, clinics, private hospitals, physio centers and private doctors.

## How the app works.
If a user is logged in, they should have access to a list of registered facilities.
The user should be able to click on any of the listed facilities based on their curated registered profile and skill set. The user should be able to view the facility‚Äôs schedule and open shifts.
The user should be able to pick and select any open shift. Upon which the user and the facility will receive a confirmation email/sms.

## How to register as a user/ service provider.
A registration form page is provided when one signs up as a health professional. A user is expected to provide required information and expected to submit it after going through and accepting the terms and conditions.

Verification process will be carried out and once it has the provider will receive a confirmation email or sms that the user has either been accepted, rejected or that more information is required.

Once the user is registered they now have access to a list of facilities they are qualified for.

## How to register as a facility.  
The facility is directed to the facility registration page where they will fill the facility  registration form.  They will provide   the facility‚Äôs name and services, departments and type of medical service professionals they need.  

Once the facility is registered and confirmed they can create a calendar and shift for each department.
